## DECAF - General Purpose Object Oriented Language
### TODO
* Finish testing AST generation using MENHIR.
* Compile a list of necessary additions to the semantic checker.
* Start on code generation.

### Issues
* Variable declaration in for-loop?
* Allow program to contain functions outside of classes? Current implementation is that everything has to be wrapped in a class declaration.
