## DECAF - General Purpose Object Oriented Language
### TODO
* Compile a list of necessary additions to the semantic checker.
* Start on code generation.

### Issues
* Allow program to contain functions outside of classes? Current implementation is that everything has to be wrapped in a class declaration. 
* Keyword "in" will cause shift/reduce conflicts with "int" since it's a prefix
